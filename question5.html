    <h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
            such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting.</dd>
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>avaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</dd>
        <dt>Node js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The
            ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the
            page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
            paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using
            different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.</dd>
        <dt>Express js</dt>
        <dd>Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with
            Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web
            applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.[4]</dd>
        <dt>React</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL
            database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB
            Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is considered
            non-free by some organizations and distributions. MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.</dd>
        <dt>Mongo db</dt>
        <dd>React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
            Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React
            applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[8][9]</dd>
